During wars and sieges, armies were able to defend the country well from this vantage point. The highlight is Soroca Fortress, one in a chain of military strongholds built as early as the 14th century by princes looking to fortify their position against invaders. Because of the large Roma community here, Soroca is the unofficial Roma capital.  For fun, walk by the mansions of the Roma elite that line the streets of the city centre."

Or better said, it is not recognized by almost no other country in the world, besides a few more in similar condition. \n\nWe were in Chisinau celebrating Saint Valentine’s day. As other thousands we have chosen Moldova to do so. We decided to add a bit more of our way of romanticism. We had heard before that no United Nations member recognises Transnistria sovereignty and the region is officially part of Moldova to UN. As of 2011, only Abkhazia, the Republic of Artsakh and South Ossetia, all of them non-recognized countries as well, recognise the independence of this particular self-declared Republic. Once in Moldova, we asked how it is in this territory and they told us that it still works de facto as a Soviet Republic since they never accepted the failure of the union. For us it was interesting enough to decide to go. \n\nMoldova is a small country and if you have some extra time to spend you can take a look at Tiraspol. So far, it is easy and cheap to arrive, you can stay there for the night or go and come back on the same day. If you want to make true the famous song of the Beatles “Back to the USSR”, keep reading, we’ll explain to you how. ",
